The current framework is working and there are several examples can be found at

https://github.com/networknt/light-example-4j/tree/master/graphql

There are several things in mind to improved it.

* Add fine-grained authorization
* Write an example with database as data source.
* Write an example with in-memory data grid as data source.
* Example of accessing other services.
