title: Hello World Tutorial
---

This is the first example application and the [README.md](https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/tree/master/graphql/hello) 
shows how to use it.

Unlike [light-java-rest](https://github.com/networknt/light-java-rest) has a [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/networknt/swagger-codegen)
to generate the project, we have to construct the project based on the [petstore](https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/tree/master/petstore)
example and modify some files for GraphQL.
